Chatbot Project

Welcome to the Chatbot Project! This repository contains the code for a simple yet effective chatbot built using Python. Our chatbot leverages natural language processing techniques to classify user intents and respond accordingly. The bot's intelligence is powered by a JSON file that stores a variety of intents and responses, making it easy to update and expand the bot's capabilities. Whether you're looking to create a customer service assistant, a personal assistant, or just a fun conversational partner, this project provides a solid foundation to get you started. Follow the installation instructions below to set up the chatbot on your local machine, and check out the JSON file structure to see how you can customize the bot's responses to suit your needs. We're excited to see what you'll build with this chatbot, and we welcome contributions and feedback from the community. Happy coding!
